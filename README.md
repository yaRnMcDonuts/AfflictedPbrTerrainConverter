# Important Notes:


- To generate a PBR Terrain with code, see this example
https://github.com/yaRnMcDonuts/PBR-Terrain/blob/master/TestAfflictedPBRTerrain.java


- to use the TerrainShaderConverter (previously contained in this project), you will now need to use the ASDUtilities library in your project https://github.com/yaRnMcDonuts/Afflicted-Scene-Designer-Utilities
